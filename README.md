## Master's student in computer science and engineering

I am currently pursuing the last year of my Master's degree in C.S. at Politecnico di Milano university and have been awarded the prestigious Erasmus scholarship to experience a one-year exchange program focused on Machine Learning at TÃ¼bingen University, Germany. I have won several autonomous driving competitions and Machine Learning competitions in Italy and Iran. 
Additionally, I do research on the following topics:

- Real-time object tracking
- Image segmentation
- Robotics spatial perception
- Feature engineering

I'm always eager to learn and I am looking for a position in an ever-growing team, in which I can not only put my knowledge into practice but also grow it through teamwork and research.
