### Master's student in computer science and engineering

I am currently pursuing my degree in C.S. at Politecnico di Milano university. I am highly interested in deep learning and its application in basically anything, however, my research is mainly focused on health care. I am passionate about studying state-of-the-art methods and how they manage to solve today's problems. Moreover, I have experience in working with different CNN architectures (VGG16, InceptionNet, ResNet, etc.), RNNs and especially LSTMs. Additionally, I am currently working on a new research paper, focusing on a new highly accurate segmentation method. My research interests are:

- Medical image processing
- Computer vision
- Feature extraction using CNN
- Segmentation

Last but not least, I am open to new opportunities and any possible collaboration.
