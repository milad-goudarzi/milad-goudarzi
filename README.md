## Master's student in computer science and engineering

I graduated with a Master's in Computer Science from Politecnico di Milano and have been awarded the prestigious Erasmus scholarship to experience a one-year exchange program focused on Machine Learning at TÃ¼bingen University, Germany. I have won several autonomous driving competitions and Machine Learning competitions in Italy and Iran. 
Additionally, I do research on the following topics:

- Real-time object tracking
- Image segmentation
- Robotics spatial perception
- Feature engineering

I'm always eager to learn and open to collaboration.
